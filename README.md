# Programming-languages-code-examples

>Hello everyone! 

`I'm newbie programmer, and when i had starting to learn some new language, i always wanted to see some example codes, to meet up with that language. So i decided to upload there few versions of Complex numbers Theory, basics of course :)
You are free to contribute and to add new languages. For now, i can write in few. Don't be afraid to message me in any doubt about codes. `

Good luck with learning!
